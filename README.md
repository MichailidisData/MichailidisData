## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nikolas and I'm a Mathematician and an aspiring Data Analyst with a backround in Data Science Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by the power of data to uncover insights and help organizations make informed decisions. I have hands-on experience with tools like Excel, SQL, and Python, and Iâ€™ve worked on several projects where I analyzed data sets to identify trends and present actionable insights. Iâ€™ve also gained proficiency in data visualization software like Tableau and Power BI.
